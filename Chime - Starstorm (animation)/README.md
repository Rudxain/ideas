An animation that syncs with that music track.

I'm considering making it a real-time HTML5 animation, to make randomly-generated parts feel more random.

I already have the idea of how it would look like in my head:
- The virtual camera will always be in the same place, but there will be vibration-effects.
- It will be 2D, with layering+parallax to make it feel 3D
- The camera landscape is a beautiful valley in an alien planet
- The sky is cloudy, some parts rain water, some parts are little stars, and sometimes it's a thunderstorm
