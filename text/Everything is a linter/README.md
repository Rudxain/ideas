(If you try hard enough.)

Code isn't the only thing that can be linted:

- Android's Digital Wellbeing is a digital health linter
- Samsung Health is a human life linter
- Melodyne is a melodic linter
- Windows has its own set system linters, which check for hardware and software problems such as: low storage, low performance, low battery, malware, etc. Windows also suggests tools and actions to its users, making the system itself a "user linter"

> to-do: add more examples later
