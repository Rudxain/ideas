What are some interesting practical implications of the Halting Problem?

A simple example, is the fact that it's impossible to predict the weather with **100% absolute accuracy** and precision.

If we [assume the Earth is an isolated particle system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow), we would need a computer the size of the **Solar System** to simulate every single particle on Earth. Even with that processing power, we still need the ability to _"fast-forward"_, which needs an even bigger computer (more than **2 [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere) required** to power it). Even with that power, we have achieved ~99.999...% accuracy.

To reach 100%, we need the ability to **predict the future**. H.P. implies there are **not 1, but 2 reasons why the general problem of "predicting the future" is both practically impossible and theoretically impossible**. We have 2 main options:

1. **Time Travel.** This is the most obvious alternative. But the speed-of-causality and grandpa-paradoxes, both forbid this.
2. **A computer twice the size of the observable universe.** Logically, this is impossible, because: If it were located within our O.U. there would be nothing to simulate. And if it were outside, there would be no way to communicate with it (quantum entanglement is not an option).

Let's assume #2 is possible, via wormholes (only used for communication with the non-observable universe), and we attempt to do it. Now the speed of light becomes a considerable limitation, we can no longer "fast-forward", not even with a [*photonic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonics) computer.

Using wormholes inside the machine, to bypass the speed of light, is "cheating", because this brings back all the causality paradoxes.

We could use **black holes** to slow down our O.U., making our "universe simulator" *relatively* (Einstein joke) faster. A naive implementation, would be to setup a homogeneous lattice of B.H.s across our entire O.U.

Now we can predict the future, anywhere in the O.U.! ... but wait, there's a small problem: **we are interacting with the machine**. We are using wormholes to get output data from the simulator, meaning that the **output must be fed-back to itself** (the machine) to reach 100% accuracy. This is uncannily similar to the thought experiment proposed by Alan Turing, but this time, the [Observer Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)) plays a "much significant" role.

Let's assume the machine can modify itself, to add more memory, to simulate an entire universe and itself... **we reached an infinitely recursive loop**. The machine must simulate itself, simulating itself, simulating itself... on and on, until its speed becomes "essentially 0".

We can no longer F.F., no matter how many B.H.s we add.

And that's how H.P. proves it's impossible to predict the future, because the only 100% reliable way is to just *let the future happen*.
