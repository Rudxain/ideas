# ideas

This hosts all the stuff that I'm too lazy/noob to begin.

Needless to say, most of this stuff is straight-up broken or completely empty, only having minimal-to-no documentation.

All sub-repos will be renamed, deleted, or moved to dedicated repos,
therefore, links to any of these sub-repos are almost guaranteed to become broken or even 100% dead, so don't @ me for not using permalinks.

## why?

If I die unexpectedly, I want people to (at least) see my works-in-progress, and potentially continue development.

Even if I don't die, I want people to give me feedback about these projects.
I want to know which are worth the time, which should be renamed, which are crap, or how can I improve them, so please be honest.

## LICENSE

The [license file at the root directory](LICENSE) applies to all sub-repos, **EXCEPT** the sub-repos that include a license (either as a file, or a source-code comment).

In other words, licenses at inner directories override licenses at outer directories
