# ðŸ’¡ ideas

This hosts all the stuff that I'm too lazy and/or noob to start making. Some of these are âœ¨dreams I wish came true, others are just crappy experiments, and others should be moved to my [blog](https://github.com/Rudxain/blog) or [wiki](https://github.com/Rudxain/RX-wiki).

Needless to say, most of the code is straight-up broken or empty, only having minimal documentation (`README.md`).

Links to any of these sub-repos are almost guaranteed to become broken or even 100% dead, so don't @ me if you don't use permalinks. This may be caused by:
- renaming directories
- deletion
- moving to dedicated (real) repos
- moving to another category directory

## Why?
As a wise human said:

While I'm alive, I want **anyone** (even AI and animals) to give me [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) about these projects.
I want to know which are worth my time, which should be renamed, which are crap, or how can I improve them, so please be honest.

When I die, I want people to read my works-in-progress, and potentially continue development
