# ideas

This will host all the stuff that I'm too lazy or inexperienced to begin

Needless to say, most of this stuff is straight-up broken or completely empty, only having minimal-to-no documentation

All sub-repos will be renamed, deleted, or moved to dedicated repos,
therefore, links to any of these sub-repos are almost guaranteed to become broken or even 100% dead, so don't @ me for not using permalinks.

## why?

If I die unexpectedly, I want people to (at least) see my works-in-progress, and potentially continue development.

Even if I don't die, I want people to give me feedback about these projects.
I want to know which are worth the time, which should be renamed, which are crap, or how can I improve them, so please be honest
