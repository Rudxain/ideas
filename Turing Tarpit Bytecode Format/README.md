# \*.ttbc

## Characteristics

- portability
- performance
- reduced memory use
- disambiguation metadata
- magic number
- Media Type `application/x-ttbc`

## Goals

- being an Intermediate Representation for esolangs from the BrainFuck family of dialects, including BusyBeavers, and FlipJump.
- make it easy for users to use esolang programs
- make it easier for interpreters (AKA *Virtual CPUs*) to run those programs, therefore increasing speed

## Future

- the formal specification
- an informal, concise, human-readable, spec
- an "official" "virtual" assembler/disassembler program
- an "official" VCPU that executes files in this format
- an example BF-to-TTBC optimizing compiler implementation
