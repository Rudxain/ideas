A Quantum-Dot AMOLED hybrid display that has an energy efficient reflective mode.

It works just like a regular QD-OLED, but the "reflective" mode uses a "backmirror" (akin to a backlight) to "recycle" external light. This mode has a much lower image quality and lower fidelity, but it'll save a ton of battery for mobile devices.

To avoid interference with OLED mode, a LCD layer can be used to act as a one-way light filter, which blocks external light in OLED mode.

To save more energy, the "resting state" of the LCD can be tuned to let light pass in both directions, by default. This has the downside  (perhaps upside?) of turning the screen into a perfect mirror when the display is off, instead of the usual black
