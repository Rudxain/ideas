When doing audio playback, interpolating the infinitesimal audio samples as sines yields better audio-quality than using sample-and-hold (piece-wise constant interpolation).

Using PWM or Black-Frame-Insertion (rather than sample-and-hold) makes animations and "moving pictures" look more fluid.

This begs the question, what if hardware pixels were "lonely" dots rather than tangent squares? Would perceived image-quality improve?
