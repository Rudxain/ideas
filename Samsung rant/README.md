# Samsung rant

> NSFW!

## Intro

I was already bored/tired of using Samsung products (specially phones), but now I'm at my **absolute limit.**

## Background

All started when I was using my Galaxy J3 Mission, tinkering around, looking at the "Running processes" section of the dev settings.
Then, I notice that the launcher (Samsung Experience Home) was running **all the time** since the device was turned on (it matched "Up Time").
The culprit was the "notification listener service", which I couldn't turn off because it was **hidden from the "Notification Access" list.**
This was very annoying, because it constantly consumed RAM for no reason.

## Present

I was gifted a Galaxy A31, I was disappointed I got yet another Samsung phone (before the J3, I had a Sony Xperia Z5, and before that I got a Galaxy S4).
But I was very happy that I could finally use Android 12, and even happier because I finally have an **unlockable bootloader!**
(I was so unlucky that the Z5 was hard-locked, not even the official Sony codes helped me. The J3 was "even-harder-locked" because of Verizon's fault)

I was doing the same monitoring+tinkering process... when suddenly... **the Game Launcher was running** for no reason. I went to the details, and guess what...
**IT'S THE FUCKING NOTIFICATION LISTENER AGAIN! AND IT'S ALSO HIDDEN FROM THE NOTIFICATION ACCESS LIST!!!**

## Other stuff I hate

For some reason, Samsung thought it's a good idea to log SMSs in the Phone app, **even if "Show messages" is disabled.**
So if you want to save storage, or increase your privacy, you're forced to enable "Show messages" to dele them.
This is even worse when the vast majority of messages are useless carrier ads and reminders, now you're forced to delete those messages **ON BOTH APPS**.

## Conclusion

Needless to say, I fucking hate Samsung, **almost as much as Apple**. I wish I had a phone by any other brand (except Huawei and Xiaomi, those are useless to me)
