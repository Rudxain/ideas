A music/game/video/whatever that illustrates the wild differences between the BB "family" members.

0. Literally nothing. The protagonist is confused and disappointed. A computer scientist explains that "0 states = the empty program" so it does nothing by definition.
1. Protag proceeds to next level, they're even more disappointed. BB(1) only does 1 thing.
2. The protag notices something hanging from the Turing-Machine, they ask the scientist, and they reply "Didn't you know TMs need memory? That hanging thing is the tape"
3. Protag is still unamused, the scientist says "Trust me, things will get crazy at level 5"
4. Things get mildly interesting. The TM no longer makes chiptune noises.
5. *The TM starts doing corrupted noises*. The long tape shifts left & right very fast.
6. **THE UNIVERSE STARTS COLLAPSING! SPACE-TIME RIFTS OPEN UP EVERYWHERE! THE TM DOESN'T SEEM TO STOP!**
