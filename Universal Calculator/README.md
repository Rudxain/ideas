# UniCalc

## Purpose

This web app allows humans to easily perform mathematical calculations using whatever positional numeral system they desire, even *"esoteric"* ones like irrational bases, complex bases, reverse ("little-endian") positional notation etc.

I did this because I'm sick of calculators only supporting standard-de-facto decimal and big-endian binary at fixed-precision.

## Capabilities

This calculator ~can~ will(?) convert any radix to any other radix (as long as the charset and numeral match and are valid).

The input and output radix can be absolutely ANY Complex number, this includes Imaginary, Real, Irrational, and Rational numbers of any sign, not just the usual positive integers.

However, radix 0 is mathematically undefined, and even if I tried to define it in my calculator, it would always be wrong, this is exactly what happens when doing arithmetic on Infinity (BTW radix Infinity is undefined too).
