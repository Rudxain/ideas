A video explaining why modern computers are actually [binary-coded-256](https://rudxain.github.io/RX-wiki/wiki/Base-Coded_Radix) (non-overlapping octets).

At the end of the video, I should make a reference to ["the best way to count"](https://youtu.be/rDDaEVcwIJM). Probably by saying "base o to the power of o o o", which means "base 2^8" (`0x100`)
