# invaria
A game where the player's avatar is a simple shape (JSaB/GD REFERENCE?!1?!1?1). They wake up next to a terminal/shell that gives them access to programs that can manipulate individual factors of reality, giving then near god-like powers. Since the terminal doesn't have a multiplexer, and there's no way to fork processes/threads, the player can only run 1 program at a time.
