Inspired by Nintendo DS. An Android app that plays specific audio/music based on foreground app. It can be a playlist for each app or just 1 audio for a list of apps.

Default audio could be silent (Only listed/supported apps play audio, any other app is silent) or sound (all apps play audio, except the ones explicitly set to silent)

Supports "./" paths, which are relative to pack root. Pack root dir is defined by the manifest (like Cargo.toml and package.json). Support for parent-dirs ("..") and general path-traversal will be added later

Name is derived from "app + motif", and the prefix reminds me of à¶žamogus

main.flo is the /Llamalab/Automate flow draft implementation
