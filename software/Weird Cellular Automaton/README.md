I have an original idea: Mix the rules of Bomberman, Snake, Minesweeper, and MC Redstone, to make a cellular automaton.

I would do it like this: In Bomberman, there's wall cells, bomb cells, and player cells. In Minesweeper, we can take inspiration from quantum mechanics, and say that "unknown cells" are in a superposition between "bomb cell" and "safe cell". With snake, we add moving snake-cells, and randomly-generated food-cells
