An AI tool that checks if your comments comply with the ToS and CoC of a given platform. If it suspects a potential violation, it warns you and prompts you before posting the comment.

This tool could be a browser extension, or an OS-level accessibility tool.

An alternative meaning of "comment linter" is a tool that checks if your source-code comments are clear and concise. If your comment is too redundant in relation to how the code is written, you get warnings. If your comments explain the "why" rather than the "what"/"how", they are less likely to trigger warnings
