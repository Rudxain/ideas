A game about Backrooms level-1, with an optional blind-mode similar to the "Lurking" game. To implement the 3D engine easily, the graphics will be similar to the original DOOM game.

The map will be randomly-generated in "chunks". Once a chunk is exited, it'll  be deleted and replaced by a new chunk. To make the game more unpredictable, chunks will have varying sizes, so you never know when you'll encounter an entirely new room.

To win the game, you must survive and find the door to the frontrooms (Earth), **but there will be entities watching and listening.**
