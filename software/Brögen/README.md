Brögen = Bruh * Jörgen.

The game intro starts with our pal Brögen fishing peacefully. He's a norwegian widower, living his life in a humble house. He likes to sing french songs to reminisce of his wife, but he also knows some italian and norwegian songs. Coming back to the intro, the **Norse Gods challenge him** to solve 1 puzzle/riddle every-day, for some reason.

The player always has more-than-enough time to solve each puzzle, ranging from **1 minute to 12 hours**, depending on the puzzle. Of course, the player can always skip time and wait for a "Failure Message From The Gods". There is no "game-over", you can continue trying to solve new puzzles even after failing the previous ones. However, **beware of the ending**, as it will be affected by your actions.

Most of the time, the player/protag will spend his time in the humble (but welcoming and comfortable) house that I mentioned previously. This house is quite beautiful. Our protag always ensures the house feels like "motherly love" to him and his visitors.

In the span of a day, the player can hear the protag singing in french, italian, or norwegian. He usually sings in french at night. The player can "join in" by pressing keys in a DDR/FNF fashion in order to play an instrument that syncs with Brögen's singing. This is entirely optional, as the player can stop playing the instrument at any time.

The game must be designed in a way that encourages the player to not speedrun, but lets them be free of doing so.

The game narrative, lore, storyline, flavor text, and jokes, should all take inspiration from Undertale/Deltarune (and fangames such as UT Yellow and DeltaTraveler), Omori, Hollow Knight, etc...

*This idea came to me in a dream.* So I "copied" Toby Fox and decided to post this, lol
