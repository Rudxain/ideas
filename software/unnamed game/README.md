# About

A game inspired by Portal (because the protagonist talks with an AI), and by Undertale & DDLC (because it breaks the 4th wall all the time).

It's about privacy in the digital age.

The AI will guess stuff about the player using all permissions/privileges explicitly granted by the player.

The AI may ask awkward and uncomfortable questions, and it will have a "passive-aggressive" (subjectively, from the player's POV) personality.

The AI will do everything in its power to remember stuff, **even after clearing the app data.**

The AI will occasionally talk about its interactions with other (real) players (if those players accept to share their game data with the public).
Of course, the AI will not leak names, nor "very personal" info.

I have no idea how to add story and lore to the game. Perhaps it doesn't need it?

The game will only be available for Android
