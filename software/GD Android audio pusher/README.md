An app that uses `adb push` to copy/move Geometry Dash audio files from a PC to an Android device.

This allows any user to avoid re-downloading audio if they already have the files in a PC

[Useful script](https://gist.github.com/nstarke/615ca3603fdded8aee47fab6f4917826). It seems this will be hard for end-users, because this reinstall deletes all user data within the app. The good news is that the reinstall only needs to be done once per update-release (which happens *once per century*)
