A programming language.

- Default radix is 1 (unary)
- Default radix can be specified via the global `Num.RADIX`. As a byproduct, it can only be specified using unary (either directly or indirectly)
- Arbitrary numerals can be written as `radix#NUM`, where `radix` is a constant expression wrapped in parentheses or a mere literal in default radix
- `bool`s are just `enum`s like in Ada and Gleam
- Numbers are ranged/bounded, with set theory syntax to unite/discard intervals/properties of numbers
- There's subroutines and fns, just like in Ada
- Fractions can have immutable denominators, allowing optimizations if denom is of the form $2^{-n}$.
- Keywords are inspired by conlangs, usually latin-based
- Syntax is Python-like, but without ":"
- There's a borrow-checker, like in Rust
- There are 3 types of chars: Unit, Point, Grapheme. Therefore 3 string types: `u_cad`, `p_cad`, `g_cad` (just lists of chars)
- Whitespace is the main delimiter, just like Lisp. So any Unicode identifier is valid, so long as it doesn't contain space (zero-width chars are forbidden too)
- Everything is immutable by default.
- Mutable variables don't inherently make their values have inner mutability, so strings are immutable by default without the need of being primitives
- [Dependent types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type)
- default behavior of arithmetic is compile-time error on overflow or underflow, don't assume wrapping/modulo
- statically/compile-time checking of **EVERYTHING**, like in Ada
- subset strings that must match a regex at compile-time
- direct (non-retroactive) type inference allowed for globals
- binary ints don't exist, use explicit bounds, like `0 < n < 9`
- `>>^` and `^<<` ops for circular (rotation) shift
- almost all arithmetic ops are variadic, so you can easily sum a list
- operators don't exist, only functions, like in Lisp
- fns can only have 0 or 1 parameters, use collection types to pass multiple values (such as `struct`s for named args)
- support floats with different mantissa and exponent sizes, don't assume IEEE-754
- support different sign bit layout for floats (only allow it at the left of mantissa, or left of exp)
- mother data structure constructor: creates any kind of data structure from the given parameters
