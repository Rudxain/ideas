Like [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) but for the `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission.

This app will allow granular control over which settings can be modified by 3rd party apps.

It will also include a settings-listener to intercept changes and revert them (only useful for apps that don't use the Setuku API)
