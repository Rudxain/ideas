# 2Twos

A game based on 2048 & 1024 (both inspired by Threes!), but more binary and unary. Any base/radix that's not 1 or 2 is forbidden here. New tiles (values 0 & 1) are added. The 0 tile is special, it has an extremely low probability of generating, and the max number of its instances (also the gen probability) are directly proportional to the table size.
