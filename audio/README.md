Ideas for mashups, remixes, bootlegs, and original audio (usually music)

## Edits

- Sonic Unleashed - Cool Edge (Day), but with lag. This would be a good joke for a SiIvagunner rip
- Cee Lo Green - Fuck You, but each slur is randomly replaced by the censored version ("Forget You")
- Deltarune - Rude Buster, comparison with Pacman theme

## Remixes

- Erik Satie - Gymnopedie No. 1
- Mii Channel (Plaza), with drums and a bassline
- Undertale - Uwa!! So Temperate♫
- Undertale - Battle Against a True Hero, but as an 80s Hip Hop
- Deltarune - Flashback (trap). Yes, I know this has been done at least twice, I just want my own version
- Silent Hill - Never Forgive Me, Never Forget Me (trap). Yes, this has been done many times
- Santana - Smooth (ElectroTango x Cuban-Son cover)
- "Nigga Song" version Dominicano (Cancion del Haitiano). I hope this isn't offensive
- Megalovania (salsa x merengue x bachata)
- Deltarune - Smart Race (latin cover)
- This Is Sparta (Dubstep remix)
- Bossfight - Okiba Crackdown: Virtual Riot Bass + Spag Heddy
