Detects palindromes, anti-palindromes, co-palindromes and anti-co-palindromes.

Anti palindrome is a string that when reversed, it's hamming distance is the maximum with the original string.
Example: "abcd" becomes "dcba", none of the characters match with each other.

A copalindrome, or partial palindrome pair, is a pair of strings that aren't palindromes independently, but become palindromes when concatenated.
Example: "abcd" & "dcba" become "abcddcba" or "dcbaabcd" which are both palindromes, so the original pair is copalindromic
